* Creating A New Angular App With Bootstrap Instructions
First, use this command:

ng new (app-name-with-dashes) --no-strict 

Ex:
ng new assignment-2 --no-strict 

Then, when it asks the following, say 'No' and hit enter:
"? Would you like to add Angular routing?"

Then, add the default CSS stylesheet and hit enter

* Adding Bootstrap To The Project
Afterwards, here are the instructions on how to add bootstrap to a project:

npm install --save bootstrap 

Then, go to the 'angular.json' file, go to projects > architect > build > styles, and make sure the following line is added:
    "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css",

* Adding 'FormsModule' To 'module' Component For Application
Annoyingly by default, Angular does NOT import the 'FormsModule' for some reason, even though it is used everywhere in a typical Angular project

This means that you have to add the import statement in the 'app.module.ts' file:

import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

You then have to add it in the 'imports' section within the 'app.module.ts' file:

  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    FormsModule
  ],
